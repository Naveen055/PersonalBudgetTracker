You are a professional full-stack developer. I want you to build me a complete **frontend-only Recurring Date Picker Component project** using **React (TypeScript)**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and using **Zustand** for state management.

This project replicates the Recurring Date Picker functionality found in apps like TickTick.

🔧 **PROJECT REQUIREMENTS**:

✅ **Framework**:  
- Use **React with TypeScript**

✅ **Styling**:  
- Style everything using **Tailwind CSS**  
- Ensure **responsive** and clean design across screen sizes

✅ **State Management**:  
- Use **Zustand** (preferred) for global state  
- Store selected frequency, interval, specific days, monthly rules, and date range

✅ **Component Breakdown**:

1. `RecurrenceOptions`  
   - Choose between Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Yearly

2. `RecurrenceSettings`  
   - Allows configuration like “Every X days/weeks/months/years”

3. `DaySelector`  
   - Multi-select weekdays (Mon, Wed, Fri)

4. `MonthlyPatternPicker`  
   - Choose a monthly pattern (e.g., 2nd Tuesday)

5. `DateRangePicker`  
   - Select Start Date (required) and End Date (optional)

6. `MiniCalendarPreview`  
   - Display the dates selected in a mini calendar  
   - Use `react-calendar` or build your own simple highlight calendar

7. `SummaryPreview`  
   - Show human-readable text like  
     “Every 2 weeks on Monday and Thursday, from July 20 to August 31”
